Hello 

This program utilizes javafx, there are many ways to install javafx but i found it easiest to just install java JDK 8 
due to it being included in the JDK.


1. Install java JDK 8 (included in this repository)
2.create a new project called pong or whatever you want, but must be a JDK 8 project (1.8)
3. run this program (or copy pase due to it only having one main class will all the code)
